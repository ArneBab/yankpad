* yankpad.el

Let's say that you have text snippets that you want to paste, but that [[http://capitaomorte.github.io/yasnippet/][yasnippet]] or [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/SkeletonMode][skeleton]] is a bit too much when you do not need a shortcut/abbrev for your snippet. You like org-mode, so why not write your snippets there? Introducing the yankpad:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
  ,* Category 1

  ,** Snippet title

  Here's a text snippet I want to insert.

  ,** List snippet

  And here's another one, with a list.

  - I like snippets
  - They are great!

  ,* Category 2

  ,** Explaining categories

  This snippet belongs to another category. Categories are useful if you need several yankpads, for instance if you're a teacher (like me) working with different courses.

  ,** yasnippet magic

  If you have yasnippet installed (not required), the content in each snippet is actually executed by yasnippet! This means that you could run elisp inside your snippets: `(+ 3 4)` and have handy tab stop fields.

  | Student | Grade |
  |---------+-------|
  | $1      | $2    |

  That's pretty handy!

#+END_SRC

** Setup

Add =yankpad.el= to your load-path and require it. The default location for the yankpad file is =yankpad.org= in your =org-directory=. This can be changed by modifying the =yankpad-file= variable.

** Usage

Add entries to your =yankpad-file=. Level 1 headings are categories and level 2 headings are snippets. Insert a snippet with =M-x yankpad-insert=. If you want to change category, use =M-x yankpad-set-category=. To quickly open your =yankpad-file= for editing, run =M-x yankpad-edit=.
